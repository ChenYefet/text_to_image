# torch is floor-constrained rather than exactly pinned because GPU (CUDA) builds
# are distributed via a separate package index and carry a local version suffix
# (e.g. 2.10.0+cu121) that does not match the plain PyPI version string. Pinning
# to a PyPI version would silently replace any pre-installed CUDA build with the
# CPU-only wheel. See README.md Step 4 for GPU installation instructions.
